// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_SEARCH to disable the functions used to search for files.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_WRITE to disable the functions that write to a drive.  Disabling this feature will
// force the file system into read-only mode.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_FORMAT to disable the function used to format drives.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_DIRECTORY to disable use of directories on your drive.  Disabling this feature will
// limit you to performing all file operations in the root directory.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_PROGRAM_MEMORY_STRINGS to disable functions that accept ROM string arguments.
// This is only necessary on PIC18 parts.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_FUNCTION_DRIVE_PROPERTIES to disable the FILEIO_DrivePropertiesGet function.  This function
// will determine the properties of your device, including unused memory.

// Uncomment FILEIO_CONFIG_MULTIPLE_BUFFER_MODE_DISABLE to disable multiple buffer mode.  This will force the library to
// use a single instance of the FAT and Data buffer.  Otherwise, it will use one FAT buffer and one data buffer per drive
// (defined by FILEIO_CONFIG_MAX_DRIVES).  If you are only using one drive in your application, this option has no effect.
