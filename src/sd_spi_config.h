//-------------Function name redirects------------------------------------------
// During the media initialization sequence for SD cards, it is
// necessary to clock the media at a frequency between 100 kHz and 400 kHz,
// since some media types power up in open drain output mode and cannot run
// fast initially.
// On PIC18 devices, when the CPU is running at full frequency, the standard SPI
// prescalars cannot reach a low enough SPI frequency.  Therefore, we provide these
// configuration options to allow the user to remap the SPI functions called during
// the "slow" part of the initialization to user-implemented functions that can
// provide the correct functionality.  For example, a bit-banged SPI module could
// be implemented to provide a clock between 100 and 400 kHz.

// For PIC18 versions of this demo, the slow functions are mapped to the fast SPI driver functions.
// The slower clock frequency will be achieved by disabling the PLL during the
// SD Card initialization.  Note that the SYS_CLK_FrequencySystemGet function 
// was implemented to return the correct clock frequency when using both a PLL-enabled 
// or PLL-disabled clock.
